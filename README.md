# Paris DeepAir Project

Le Wagon - Bootcamp Data Science - Paris - Full time

Batch #1002 - 03/10-09/12/2022

End-of-studies project presented (4 contributors)

------------------------------------------------

## Context

Paris DeepAir Project is an end-of studies project carried-out by 4 students from [Le wagon data science school](https://www.lewagon.com/data-science-course). The goal of this project is to predict the air quality in Paris on a horizon of 7 days, using time series with machine learning & deep learning, based on data from [Airparif](https://www.airparif.asso.fr/), the official air quality monitoring agency for ÃŽle-de-France region.

------------------------------------------------

## Preliminary steps to carry-out

**Local repo setup:**
- Clone the project
- Create a virtual environment for this project named "PDPA-virt_env"
- Assign this virtual environment to the project
- Run the virtual environment into the local repo
- Into the CLI type:
```shell
make reinstall_package
```


**Data & files:**
- Download & paste the "data" folder into the local cloned version of the repo
- Create a ".env" file


**Jupyter notebook setup - to be done on CLI:**
```shell
# Install nbextensions
jupyter contrib nbextension install --user
jupyter nbextension enable toc2/main
jupyter nbextension enable collapsible_headings/main
jupyter nbextension enable spellchecker/main
jupyter nbextension enable code_prettify/code_prettify
```

------------------------------------------------

## Folder structure

**Folders description:**
- **data**: all data used for this project (5 years on an hourly basis)
- **documentation**: all the technical documentation consulted for this project
- **model_greykite**: ML models for each pollution cluster
- **notebooks**: individual notebooks for this project
- **workflow**: all the workflow for our model, divided in .py files

------------------------------------------------

## Dataset description

**Pollutants (French / English) in the ATMO  index:**
- **PM 2,5**: particules fines / fine particles
- **PM 10**: particules moyennes / medium particles
- **NO2**: dioxyde d'azote / nitrogen dioxide
- **O3**: ozone / ozone
- **SO2**: dioxyde de souffre / sulfur dioxide

Pollutants measured but not-included in the ATMO index - dropped :
- **CO**: monoxyde de carbone / carbon monoxide
- **NO**: monoxyde d'azote / nitrogen monoxide
- **NOX**: oxydes d'azote / nitrogen oxydes


Measure unit for all pollutants : mg/m3


In this project, 20 stations were selected (Paris intra-muros). All pollutants are not monitored in every station, each station is specialized in several pollutants. In total, there are :
- **NO2**: 20 stations
- **PM10**: 11 stations
- **PM2.5**: 6 stations
- **O3**: 5 stations
- **SO2**: 4 stations

Then, data from these 20 stations was grouped into 5 clusters : West, East, North, South, Center

## ATMO Index

The ATMO index is a daily indicator of air quality, calculated from concentration into the air of regulated pollutant. This index classifies air quality into 6 classes (from good to extremely bad).

First, a sub-ATMO index is calculated for each regulated air pollutant, then a global ATMO index is calulated from these sub-ATMO indexes. The global ATMO index is equal to the worst classification of sub-ATMO indexes for the given day.

ATMO index classification :
